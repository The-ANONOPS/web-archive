## Description

Web Archives is a browser extension which helps you to find
archived and cached versions of web pages. Searches can be initiated from
the right-click context menu, the browser toolbar, or the address bar
in case of a server error.

#### Search Engines

A diverse set of archive and cache sources are supported,
which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options.
Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.
